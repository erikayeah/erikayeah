### 👩‍💻 About me

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** with a background in team coordination and agile project management. My career path led me from working with people to building products that serve them.

During the pandemic, I shifted to tech — and since then, I’ve been committed to learning, building, and improving. I’ve worked on projects that include e-commerce platforms, blockchain apps, and RESTful APIs, both on the frontend and backend.

Right now, I'm focused on growing as a **MERN developer** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), while deepening my backend and DevOps knowledge.

### 🌱 Continuous Learning & Growth

I'm committed to growing as a developer through hands-on practice and ongoing learning.

- I regularly build and iterate on small applications to deepen my understanding of JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
- I'm currently exploring backend architecture, APIs, testing, and deployment workflows.
- I value clean code, user experience, and collaboration in real-world environments.

🧠 Many of the projects I’ve worked on involved frontend development, API integrations, and solving real-world issues — all focused on improving usability and reliability.
